@mpbMKE @magical_grill This brings up a good destinction. SFX vs Music. What do you think about when making? #mochat
@mpbMKE What kind of people do you normally hand things off to? #mochat
@_five31 I was about to say when thinking about sharp animations making mouth sfx always helps me visualise the motion I want #mochat
@magical_grill I find that when I‚Äôm designing/animating with a particular sound in mind the end result turns out to feel better #mochat

@flabbyironman @DerekTac @Zonaefly True. I just don‚Äôt want people to think they need protools to add mograph sounds #mochat
@Zonaefly If we all rendered ANIMATION then files would be big. Codecs compress differently and have different features (like alpha) #mochat

"@Zonaefly honestly, things can take as much time as you give them. You can tweak forever. Try to set an internal metric(eg:30s=8h) #mochat"
@magical_grill @flabbyironman @MotionChat That's why you can't have vector layers in 3D at the same time. It can't do both together #mochat

@sthig @_five31 This reminds me of this amazing explainer . Quality‚Äôs top notch https://t.co/UpwfohdzoJ
"When I was thinking about places this topic could go, I also thought about Data Visualisation and things like Architectural vids #mochat"
We‚Äôre coming up on the last 10 minutes of tonight‚Äôs #mochat. Can you think of any other interesting venues for #mograph to shine in?
@JackSabbath2D @sthig @_TimIsKing @caitcadieux @Zonaefly I used to think that but then smartboards took off #mochat
"@_five31 @seeinggreene ""It‚Äôs like a kindle on your arm!‚Ä¶ wait what do you mean it‚Äôs a different kind of digital ink?‚Äù #mochat"
@seeinggreene I did an animated T-Shirt project last year and wait everyday for them to be real. #mochat
@DavidBStanfield Can‚Äôt wait to see it! I love things when they‚Äôre so simple they get to stand on their own merits #mochat
@caitcadieux @Zonaefly @_TimIsKing Many things didn‚Äôt click for me in school until I could see it or it was explained until I could #mochat
"@Zonaefly @_TimIsKing I love these explainers too, but thinking about it I can see classroom animations as a huge untapped market. #mochat"
"@DavidBStanfield I‚Äôm glad that it‚Äôs being noticed. Not only for jobs, but they get a better overall product and experience out of it #mochat"
@_five31 I seriously came back from NAB and made cells for about a week I was so inspired. #mochat

Another application I hadn't thought of is Medical Imaging. I was blown away by what I saw at the Maxon NAB booth in March.  #mochat
@Zonaefly see snapchat filters as a great area for #mograph to expand into #mochat
@_TimIsKing there‚Äôs one on my commute but it just cycles through different stills. WASTED opportunity to get engagement #mochat
@_five31 I've done a few sports stadiums and working in odd aspect ratios and in playback constraints can be fun!  #mochat
"@_five31 I was shocked at how much mograph I saw while walking around NAB this march #mochat Signs, Demos, and more."
Digital Signage is a HUGE opportunity that a lot of us haven't touched. Go to Vegas and see nothing but #mograph @_five31 #mochat
@seeinggreene sounds like you‚Äôre on the @eyedesyn path! #mochat
@_five31 It's the little things that really matter when using an app/website/terminal that make it feel good  #mochat
@zacdixon @_TimIsKing has anyone used Squall? I haven‚Äôt but it looks cool https://t.co/I2S2fIViCm #mochat
@seeinggreene I see it as a cool way to use my skills in a new and interesting way I hadn't thought of before. #mochat
@_TimIsKing with the amount I see on @dribbble I‚Äôd expect better UI/UX animation to be everywhere. Might be biased though #mochat
"@zacdixon I was hoping #MaterialDesign would help with that, but like a lot of things it‚Äôs not given to designers #mochat"
@zacdixon that‚Äôs unfortunate. I see a lot a mediocre/bad animation in UI nowadays #mochat
@Zonaefly @JackSabbath2D I wish gifs translated better into a video format. I guess that‚Äôs by design though #mochat
".@_five31 and @animalators bring up UI/UX in motion design, Have you guys seen a lot of these kinds of things popping up? #mochat"
@_TimIsKing wazzup?
@JackSabbath2D @caitcadieux @Zonaefly https://t.co/HNzQhX3Qav The watchmen motion comic always sticks in my mind #mochat
@_five31 I'm always shocked to find agencies without them. How do you guys make ads?!  #mochat
@seeinggreene welcome!
@_five31 @Zonaefly This is sweet and i‚Äôm behind it 100% #mochat
"@sthig True, it‚Äôs a process in a similar vein. Exporting from AE into something else. Gives a lot of new people access to #mograph #mochat"
@caitcadieux @Zonaefly I‚Äôve seen quite a few. It‚Äôs a cheap way to make a narrative video without complicated character anim #mochat
"@sthig I should probably have heard of bodymovin, but it looks very similar to squall. Different markets tho https://t.co/I2S2fIViCm #mochat"
@_five31 I haven‚Äôt listened to the most recent  @animalators episode yet. What did they talk about? #mochat
@_five31 What do you mean? #mochat
"There are a lot of fields adjacent to motion design, and one I see with a lot of immediate #mograph potential is UI/UX.  #mochat"
@caitcadieux no sÃ∂oÃ∂uÃ∂pÃ∂ explainers for you! #mochat
"Every day there are new avenues for #mograph that didn‚Äôt exist 10 years, last year, or even yesterday. What do you see out there? #mochat"

The second half of #LetsPlayLive way way better than the first. That's what I was looking for.
"I'm hopeful for the second half of #LetsPlayLive. All these people make great content that I like, something's falling short though."
"I expected #LetsPlayLive to be a live version of their videos, but it's kinda like they crossed high school theater with @AchievementHunt"
Maybe let the games make the content and not script everything? #LetsPlayLive
The good parts of #LetsPlayLive are the games and they're great but the skits  and forced bits make it hard to swallow.
#LetsPlayLive needs to hire a broadcast director and live switch. I expected a video game show to have more games.

"@madebyflame I don't disagree with you, but then I see this https://t.co/kymFoaHSql #mochat"
@caitcadieux @conigs @friedpixels are we in for  a bunch of Stranger Things titles? How do we deal with that? #mochat
@madebyflame @caitcadieux At what point does your inspired by @beeple render become something of your own? #mochat
@Oddernod Where‚Äôs the line for you? #mochat
@conigs So if you‚Äôre copying to learn you should never post any of it online? #mochat
@Zonaefly So for you it‚Äôs okay to replicate as long as credit is where credit is due? #mochat
"@MikeOverbeck Long shadows seem to have come and gone, but does that throw doubt onto everyone who made them? #mochat"

"Public Rail Transport in the capital of ""the greatest nation on earth"" is a disgrace. A disgrace of disgustingly used carpet."
This is a common occurrence. Perpetuated by the wmata system and its caretakers. It has only gotten worse while I've lived on the district.
A fight is about to break out on this red line train because there are no other options besides pushing and standing on others.
Having trains come in pairs forces stations to crowd. Especially when a 6 car train comes first. Exacerbating the problem of crowding
Not one day this week has the red line not had an incident during rush hour. 5 days in a row. The DC citizens can do nothing but endure.
"When rush hour trains only come closer to 10 minutes, metro has created an unhealthy system of overcrowding when you fight to be on time."

@conigs @hypercubexl 3D scenes can get complicated fast. AE makes keyframe animation easy. sometimes we forget that #mochat
@conigs how did the topic of simulations become expressions and expresso haha? #mochat
@hypercubexl @Pojemotion @conigs 2d people use stock footage a lot. you can tweak action essentials to do quite a bit.  #mochat
@conigs I think 3D lens itself to a lot of detail and 'realism' whereas 2D lends itself to stylization and suspension of disbelief  #mochat
@hypercubexl @Pojemotion @conigs I'd say particle sims count.  #mochat
@congis @caitcadieux @imjohnflores_ @conigs Mr. @eyedesyn has a simple expresso tut on this. use this to control that #mochat
@conigs I'd second that.  #mochat
"@hypercubexl @darthcasey @Pojemotion @conigs Simulate the things that would be a bitch to do with keyframes.Things breaking, hair... #mochat"
@imprevade @Pojemotion @JackSabbath2D @conigs at that point why even use it at all? #mochat
@Zonaefly @imprevade @Pojemotion @JackSabbath2D an easy way to distinguish sims is you push play. then you like it or not. done. #mochat
@Pojemotion @imprevade @JackSabbath2D @conigs I find those kind of expressions kinda overkill. just as easy to add 2 overshoot keys #mochat
@Pojemotion @conigs You gain a certain complexity of motion and lose control unless you take the time to tweak the parameters.  #mochat
@conigs I find that certain motions and transitions lend themselves to simulations than others #mochat
"@Zonaefly @conigs basically you can set everything up and hit play, and it'll figure out everything out. - control + realism #mochat"
@Zonaefly @conigs Simulations vs Manual keyframing #mochat

Had an early shoot so I couldn't finish last night's #5DayMograph #FollowThrough #OffsetMotion. Based on a #gif. http://t.co/RcVE7TCoR2
Have you ever not been able to start shooting because your actor didn't have hands? #meirl
Early morning call for a shoot couldn't finish my follow-through gif. Got the framework though. Guess I'm doubling down tonight

Dammit. How are all of my thoughts 150 characters long? #twitterProblems
@jasonpoley @madebyflame @Oddernod @hungrymindcg I'm always worried that'll get into photoshop painting territory  #mochat
@madebyflame @Oddernod @hungrymindcg @conigs Just as long as no one can tell the difference!  #mochat
"@Oddernod @madebyflame So you're specifying it to those who run the sims, modellers, animators, and compositors as VFX people? #mochat"
@ericdarnell @hungrymindcg Where are these shirts? Where can I put my money?
@madebyflame There's nothing like seeing excellent motion design combined with excellent vfx. #knocksyoursocksoff #mochat
@hungrymindcg @madebyflame Honestly it was the first time I ran into a HUGE tracking issue. So now I'm confident it'll always work #mochat
#VFX artists have to have their animations down pat because it's constantly compared with the real thing. #mograph can be abstract #mochat
@madebyflame @hungrymindcg @conigs I had a track where all the points but 3 weren't sticking and I just solved off of those. Done! #mochat
@hungrymindcg @conigs @madebyflame If at first your track can't succeed... track. track. again. #mochat
@conigs @madebyflame But isn't it so satisfying when you stick the track and everything interacts?  #mochat
@conigs Is is accurate to say clients looking for a corporate mograph video might not knot know what they want vs VFX studio clients #mochat
@thesteveblu I can feel ya there. How aren't we even halfway yet?!
@conigs Diversity of work for sure. Can't get burnt out with shape layers when compositing!  #mochat
"@Oddernod @madebyflame @conigs So ""What can we do?"" vs ""What can we do on time/budget?"" or just a general urgency? #mochat"
@Oddernod @madebyflame @conigs This is interesting to me. Can you explain? #mochat
@conigs Can you make a screen? can you replace this screen? Can you hide this screen? can you hide this wire? can you hide that car? #mochat
"@hungrymindcg 

oh

#mochat"
@conigs @madebyflame Oh yeah. We could only wish it happened like that all the time. Generally the ones who have the $ know da least #mochat
@madebyflame I know people who have had this happen to them as a test. Said they couldn't do it and got hired for being honest. #mochat
@hungrymindcg Yo! You're an animator right? Can you make me a short video? Like Wall-E but like 5 minutes. That's what you do right? #mochat
@zacdixon @conigs I can imagine this happening easily. What was the context?  #mochat
@conigs AKA: everyone outside of the industry of film and video. #mochat
@conigs Alarms tend to shock people out of work trances. Though honestly not always. #mochat
@conigs Evening everyone #mochat
Separating dimensions was probably a poor idea. #AfterEfects
Oh I'll do something clever and simple for the #5DayMograph on #Easing. Oh. w-w-w-Wait‚Ä¶ What have I done? How did this happen to me?
Not going to miss #mochat tonight. I set an alarm!

Actually I extend it to everyone. Take an audio tech class so you know what can and can't be done. Knowing is half the battle.
Hey. Motion Designer out there. Take that audio-technology class. It's been a lot of my freelance work so far. I'd be lost without it.
